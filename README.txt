Here are 6 advanced strategies that should give you much larger improvements:
Key Insights from Your Current Results:
* You're only getting 0.6% profit improvement ($1.2M on ~$187M)
* Both models are performing very similarly (85% accuracy, 34-36% precision on defaults)
* The issue isn't just architecture - it's also about feature engineering and training approach

Why the improvement is small:
1. Feature overlap: Your financial/behavioral split may not be creating truly specialized knowledge
2. Limited architectural difference: The meta-learning model isn't different enough from monolithic
3. Standard training: Both models are learning the same patterns in the same way

Advanced Strategies to Try:
1. Risk-Based Feature Engineering (Biggest potential impact)
* Creates payment-to-income ratios, employment stability metrics, combined risk scores
* These engineered features often provide 2-5% improvement alone
* Meta-learning works better when base models have truly different input representations

2. Attention-Based Architecture
* Multi-head attention lets financial and behavioral branches "talk to each other"
* Cross-attention helps the model learn which behavioral patterns matter for different financial profiles
* This can capture interactions your current concatenation approach misses

3. Ensemble Meta-Learning
* Multiple specialized models with different architectures and hyperparameters
* Learned weighting instead of simple averaging
* Often provides 1-3% improvement over single models

4. Risk Stratification
* Separate models for different risk groups (high-risk, medium-risk, low-risk borrowers)
* Each specialist model becomes an expert on its risk segment
* Can improve performance on the hardest-to-classify cases

5. Advanced Business Loss Function
* Probability calibration prevents overconfident predictions
* Dynamic loss weighting based on business impact
* Uncertainty estimation for better threshold selection

6. Enhanced Training Process
* Larger batch sizes (256 vs 128) for better gradient estimates
* More sophisticated callbacks that optimize for business metrics
* Better regularization with calibration terms

Expected Improvements:
* Feature Engineering: +2-4% profit improvement
* Attention Architecture: +1-2% profit improvement
* Risk Stratification: +1-3% profit improvement
* Combined Effect: Potentially +5-10% total improvement (vs your current 0.6%)

To implement:
1. Start with the risk-based feature engineering - this often has the biggest single impact
2. Try the attention-based architecture - it's designed for exactly your use case
3. If those work well, add risk stratification for the final push
The key insight is that meta-learning shines when the base models are truly specialized and learn different aspects of the problem. Your current approach may be too similar to be worth the complexity.
